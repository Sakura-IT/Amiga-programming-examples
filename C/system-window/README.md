# System Window

Opens an empty system window on the Workbench screen. Then waits for closing the window with the close gadget. It also illustrates the following:
* Minimal startup code instead of the standard one.
* Usage of tag based API functions.
* Simple makefile of the project for GNU Make.

The project has been compiled with Amiga native GCC 2.95.3. Note that the program requires Kickstart 3.0+, it will exit on older kickstart. System version check is implemented by requiring _dos.library_ v39+ in the startup code.

### Opening a window

Windowing system of the Amiga has two levels. Lower level is _layers.library_, which deals with rectangle, arbitrarily overlapped fragments of screen. Usually applications do not use _layers.library_ directly. Upper level of windowing system is _intuition.library_ which also handles user input and provides primitives for gadgets aka user controls.

The _intuition.library_ provides two calls for window creation.
* OpenWindow() is an older form, which takes window parameters as a fixed, prefilled structure. It works with all versions of AmigaOS.
* OpenWindowTags() is a modern form. It takes window parameters as a taglist. Taglist is an array of key-value pairs. The function builds tag array from variable arguments. This function has been introduced in the system v2.0. I use this form, as it is easier to use. One has to specify only attributes with non-default values.

In the example I use tags to specify following window properties:
* Inner (inside borders) width and height in pixels. Thickness of window borders depends on user preferences like display mode, screen font and so on. When inner values are specified, space for borders is added automatically.
* Standard gadgets for window closing, depth arranging and the title bar (also used to move the window by dragging).
* Window title, displayed on the title bar.
* Accepted categories of window messages (usually generated by user input). In this example I only accept IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW messages. A message of this category is generated when user closes the window with the close gadget.
